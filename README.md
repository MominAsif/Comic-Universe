# Comic-Universe

Explanation of App:

You are first brought to the Welcome Screen where you can create an account, login, or continue without account. The create account screen takes you to the Profile screen where the username you entered displays and everything else is hard coded like the followers. The search screen allows you to search for any comic book character and then the screen retrieves data from the ComicVine API and displays images of the comics and names of comics. Clicking on the comic brings you to a screen where you can read more details on that comic. The character screen lets you click on the image of a few hard coded character images that automatically searches comics for you. The list screen allows you to make comic book lists and title them.
